# Ranger-700-Control

This is going to be my project for creating an ECM "Electronic control module" for my 2007 Polaris Ranger 700.

These models have a known issue with the factory ECM burning up in various ways causing the need for a replacement, my goal is to have an arduino act as a replacement using relays and sensors to control the different functions the original ECM controlled.

I would also like to work on integrating a touch screen into the system to display speed, temps, indicators and various other information for the machine.
